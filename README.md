Impressive Editor
=================

A dirty hack to make a frontend of [Impressive presentation tool][1]
for those who are too lazy to launch a terminal.

Impressive is a convenient presentation tool, but it must use command
line to launch and is very difficult to configure slides. I was asked by
a Impressive user to make this frontend, and they want to pack this
application to their educational distro (named EzGo) based on Ubuntu.

Requirements (in Debian)
------------------------

* python-qt4
* poppler-utils

### Build Requirements

* pyqt4-dev-tools
* qt4-linguist-tools
